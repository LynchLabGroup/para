### Transcription Factor Binding Site Detection ###

Code for the Transcription Factor Binding Site project.

# Idea #

Take genomes sequences of organisms -> annotate them to know genes

Take genes sequences -> retrieve upstream sequences using annotation file and verify there is no overlapping genes

Compare these upstream sequences among several lineages according to gene familes: Identify conserved or divergent motifs using **BigFoot**

Relate these differences of motifs with expression data, GO terms, etc.
