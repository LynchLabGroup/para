Analysis of WGD2 families
=========================

Loading and general view of WGD2 families

```{r}
setwd("../")
families = read.csv("family_WGD2_sizes.csv", sep="\t")
head(families)
summary(families)
```

What does the distribution looks like

```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
library(ggplot2)
source("multiplot.R")
gg = ggplot(families,aes(x=size))
p1 = gg + geom_histogram() + theme_bw() + labs(x="WGD2 family sizes (number of genes)", y="Count")
p2 = gg + geom_density() + theme_bw() + labs(x="WGD2 family sizes (number of genes)", y="Count")
multiplot(p1,p2)
```

What value use? Try looking at various percentiles
```{r}
sizes = families$size
quantile(sizes,c(.25,.1,.05,.01,.001))
```
